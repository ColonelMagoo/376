    <p>Waluigi's debut came in Mario Tennis on the N64 because Wario was planned to be in the game but was the only character without a duos partner. It was because of this that they created a new character. Like Wario, he is considered to be a more exagerated form of his counterpart Luigi.</p>
    <p>It is because of this appearence that he is often depicted with a Tennis Racket in his hand.</p>
